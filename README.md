# MY_SOKOBAN
Epitech Tech 1 Project

Lib : Ncurses.

This project is based on a puzzle video game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations.

The map who representing a warehouse, containing :
"#" = Walls.
"P" = Player.
"X" = Boxes.
"O" = Storage locations.

You play as a player who can only move up and down, right to left onto an empty square but never through a wall.
The player can also move into a box, which pushes it into the square beyond.
However, boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls and they can't be pulled.

The goal of the game is to put every boxes to the storage locations
